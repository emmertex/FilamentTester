## Why ?
Knowing what colour, and transparency each filament is, is very difficult to do.  
Print a flat disc, and use a colorometer, then print a bunch of varying layer thicknesses and observe subjectively.

### But why? 
Because HueForge is awesome.    
Check it out here.

But also, I have a lot of filaments, and matching them in CAD for clients, and personal reasons would be super beneficial.

### TD-1 by AJAX 
So I ordered a kit, and assembled it.  Well, it had severe issues.   
A collection of AliExpress parts wasn't the problem, the code was.    
The colour was way off.  Transmissive Distance seemed good, repeatable, but only solved half the problem.  
I sent an email, I contacted them in private and public on Discord, but unfortunately AJAX had no interest in discussing the issues.  
In the end I offered to help in a private message, which went ignored.
So Ignored privately sent messages, and dismissed public ones. 
After a day of no response to my DM, I started taking things into my own hands.  
Yes. I know he seen it, as he commented and communicated with many others during this time.

## The Plan
1 - Scan a few filament
2 - Compare against HueForge
3 - Compare against Test Prints
4 - Wipe the RP2040 and start from scratch
5 - Whatever I feel like. 


## Day 1
Getting the Hardware Working
 
[Benchmark using  TD-1](Benchmark%20using%20%20TD-1.md)

[Discover the Hardware and get it working](Discover%20the%20Hardware%20and%20get%20it%20working.md)

[Tying it all together](Tying%20it%20all%20together.md)

## Day 2  
Making the Outputs valid, and validating  
This stage may take a while due to test prints, and analysis

I am releasing now, despite a LOT more to go in regards to calibration, so that there is something more usable. 

AJAX has contacted me after seeing my reddit post, and is away of this repo.
